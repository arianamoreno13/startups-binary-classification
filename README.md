# Venture Funding With Deep Neural Network 
--
## Description
This file is a Jupyter Lab notebook that employs Python to read a .csv file and applies deep neural network learning using TensorFlow and Keras to run machine learning models. The objective of these models is to predict future outcomes with as close to 100% accuracy as possible. A data analyst can use these models to analyze specific target data to anticipate future outcomes, and subsequently create company policies to achieve desirable results. To obtain the desired level of accuracy, the data analyst will have to make numerous trial-and-error adjustments to the code.
